### Python-Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Basics of Numpy, Pandas , Matplotlib, Seaborn | Projects

ðŸ‘‰**1. Why Numpy?**
NumPy arrays are faster and more compact than Python lists. An array consumes less memory and is convenient to use. NumPy uses much less memory to store data and it provides a mechanism of specifying the data types.

ðŸ‘‰**2. Why Pandas?**
Pandas is a Python library for data analysis. Pandas is built on top of two core Python librariesâ€”matplotlib for data visualization and NumPy for mathematical operations. Pandas acts as a wrapper over these libraries, allowing you to access many of matplotlib's and NumPy's methods with less code.

ðŸ‘‰**3. Why Matplotlib?**
Matplotlib is a multi-platform data visualization library built on NumPy arrays.

ðŸ‘‰**4. Why Seaborn?**
Seaborn is a library in Python predominantly used for making statistical graphics. Seaborn is a data visualization library built on top of matplotlib and closely integrated with pandas data structures in Python. Visualization is the central part of Seaborn which helps in the exploration and understanding of data.

**PROJECT: Pandas - Exploring Countries Economic Data**
This project involved the process of importing, exploring, and analyzing a dataset using Python and its powerful libraries like pandas and seaborn. The workflow included data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization to extract insights from the data.
